# Getting Started
To create your first Bradypodion app, please make sure you have installed [npm](https://npmjs.org/), the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) package manager. Also please install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [bower](http://bower.io/) globally: `npm install -g bower grunt`

## Using the seed repository
You can [fork](https://github.com/excellenteasy/bradypodion-seed) or [download (as zip)](https://github.com/excellenteasy/bradypodion-seed/archive/master.zip) bradypodion-seed, a repository that implements our recommended workflow when working with Bradypodion.

Now change into the directory you cloned or downloaded and unzipped the repo to, for example `cd ~/Downloads/bradypodion-seed-master`. Install both the build process and frontend dependencies using `npm install` and `bower install`.

## Starting the development workflow
The main grunt task to use is `grunt serve`. Enter this into your terminal and the app should show up in a new browser tab within seconds. All source code that gets compiled by the build process is located inside the `app` folder. If you change any of the fildes inside the `scripts`, `styles` or `view` folder, grunt will automatically recompile and reload all instances of your app (across devices).
